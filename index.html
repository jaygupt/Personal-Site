        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I started learning how to code when I was in my freshman year of high school.
          I took many courses in a college setting, and am currently learning more through the web. I am
          an aspiring full-stack developer.

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I like to write. I have been writing in my school newspapers since, again, my freshman year.
          I think writing and coding have a lot in common; they require critical thinking, among other skills.
